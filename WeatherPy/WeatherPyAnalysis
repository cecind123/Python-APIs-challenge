Based on the data:

1. There seems to be a direct correlation between temperature and latitude. 
(Temperature increases as you approach the equator at 0 degrees latitude)

2. There does not appear to be a correlation between latitude and cloudiness. 

3. There seems to be a slight increase in wind speed as you move away from equator. 
This may be unrelated to latitude, however it is worth noting that the highest wind speeds were 
found further away from the equator. 

4. There does not appear to be a correlation between latitude and humidity.
