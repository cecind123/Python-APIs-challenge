In this assignment, I wrote Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. I used the OpenWeatherMap API to create a representative model of weather across world cities. 

The script does all of the following: 

    -Randomly selects at least 500 unique cities based on latitude and longitude.
    -Performs a weather check on each of the cities using a series of successive API calls.
    -Includes a print log of each city as it's being processed with the city number and city name.
    -Saves both a CSV of all data retrieved and png images for each scatter plot.

From there, I built a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

    -Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
    -Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
    -Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
    -Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
